The topic of my bachelors' thesis at MFF UK was identification of meteor showers. This is done using measures in the space of orbital parameters called _$D$-criteria_.

The `MeteorShowerIdentificationConsole` program takes a set of meteor orbits and optionally a set of meteor _shower_ orbits and assigns the meteors to meteor showers using the $D$-criteria. Since the mathematical form of the $D$-criteria makes them impossible to optimize algorithmically, the program was designed to be as memory stable as possible, because, besides parallelization, there is not much one can do with a $\mathcal{0}(n^2)$ time complexity.
