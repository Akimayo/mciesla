Hello!

My name is **Michal Ciesla** (pronounced <span className="phonetic">[mɪxʌl cɪeslʌ]</span>, but for the first name, Michael is fine). I come from northern Bohemia (the Czech Republic) and am something what others would call "the IT guy".

I develop software as both a profession and a hobby. I'm interested in computer science, coding, feats of modern technology, space, and I know my way around several scientific fields. I studied computer science in both secondary school and college and currently I'm studying physics at a university.

I have been dancing (semi-)profesionally at my home dance school since 2010. This place has become a sort of second family to me and I've become a lecturer there in 2016. Thanks to dancing, I also taught myself how to edit music (I use **FL Studio 20** to make music mixes for dance choreographies).

My favourite genre of music is EDM (House, Melodic Dubstep and similar), I admire singers of most genres, and sometimes I also like to listen to some atmospheric instrumental music.

Animated movies for kids are my favourite kind of movies and I am a fan of anime movies and short anime series (all-time favourites are **Howl's Moving Castle** and **Your Lie In April**).

In my free time I like to play some video games, such as **Minecraft**, **Minecraft Dungeons**, **Stardew Valley**, **Terraria**, **Dyson Sphere Program** or **GRIS**.
